This project demonstrates my ability to handle end to end machine learning tasks, such as:  preprocessing and cleaning sensor data, extracting meaningful features and reducing dimensionality, building and comparing predictive models tailored for time-series data, and designing custom algorithms for domain-specific tasks such as repetition counting.
